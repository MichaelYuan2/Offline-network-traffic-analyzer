# Network Packet Analyzer

## Purpose of the Project
The Network Packet Analyzer is designed to process and analyze network packets from pcap files. It helps in understanding network behaviors, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring network security by providing detailed insights into the traffic. This is also serves as a course final project for CSCI-SHU 308 Computer Networking.

## How to Run the Code
